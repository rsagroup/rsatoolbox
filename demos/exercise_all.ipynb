    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In these three exercises you will get an introduction to the functionality of the new pyRSA-toolbox for inferring the underlying model representation based on measured data. Generally we assume that there is a true underlying representation, which is captured by our model. The measurement process like fMRI will lead to a distorted view of that representation, which we may or may not include into our analysis as an explicit measurement model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For illustration these exercises use simulated RDMs from the paper \"Inferring brain-computational mechanisms with models of activity measurements\" by Kriegeskorte & Diedrichsen (2016). Ground truth RDMs are here simulated based on the layers of Alexnet--the deep neural network model, which sparked the interest in deep learning. Simulated data rdms were generated as follows: First, voxel responses were generated by randomly selecting locations within the layer and modelling their response as a local average of the feature values. Then, noise was added to those voxel responses and RDMs were computed from these noisy responses. As model predictions to compare to, we use noise-free RDMs generated for each layer, by applying different amounts of smoothing and averaging to the layer representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our overall aim in this setting is to infer which representation the data rdms were based on, i.e. which layer was used for generating the data. Towards this aim we will make three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Exercise 1*, we will load the data, convert them into the formats used in the toolbox and have a first exploratory look at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Exercise 2*, we will compare the RDMs based on the undistorted representations to the simulated data RDMs. This is the classical and simplest approach and already allows us to perform model comparisons and the general evaluation of model-RDMs. This approach uses *fixed models*, i.e. each model predicts a single fixed RDM. We will see that this does not allow us to correctly infer the underlying representation though, because the measurement process distorts the RDMs too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Exercise 3*, we will apply *flexible models*. This means that each model predicts a distribution of RDMs. In the present context this means that the model is flexible in which measurement model is applied to explain the data. To evaluate such flexible models additional cross-validation is necessary, which we also discuss in this exercise."

An unbiased performance estimate therefore requires independent test data. Crossvalidation is a data-efficient way of obtaining an unbiased performance estimate.\n",
