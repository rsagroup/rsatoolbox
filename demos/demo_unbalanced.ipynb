Such data is common in neural recordings where individual neurons may become unmeasureable during an experiment such that we do not have measurements of all neurons for all stimuli. A common reason for different numbers of repetition for a stimulus are trials which have to be removed due to artifacts or aborted experiments or because the experimentor did not have full control over which stimuli were shown."

    "\n",
    "You may ask yourself why there are separate functions for computing RDMs for balanced and unbalanced designs. The main reason for this is that the functions for balanced designs average the different measurements for the same stimulus first and then calculate dissimilarities of these average activations. Computing this average requires that the same channels were measured for all repetitions of the stimulus though, which breaks this computation, when measurements are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a compatible method for computing the dissimilarities we decompose the formula into a sum of kernel evaluations, which we can average correctly. As an example, this is the decomposition for the euclidean distance $d_{xy}$ of two patterns with measured representations $x_i$ and $y_j$ for $i = 1 \\dots N_x, j = 1 \\dots N_y$, denoting the mean representations as $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ for a single measurement channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "d_{xy} &=& (\\bar{x} - \\bar{y}) ^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{N_x} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_x} x_i - \\frac{1}{N_y} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_y} y_j \\right) ^2 \\\\\n",
    "&=& \\frac{1}{N_x N_x} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_x} \\sum_{i'=1}^{N_x} x_i x_{i'} + \\frac{1}{N_y N_y} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_y} \\sum_{j'=1}^{N_y} y_j y_{j'} - \\frac{2}{N_x N_y} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_x} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_y} x_i y_j\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the dissimilarities for more than one measurement channel we simply need to comput this value per channel and average. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we now decomposed the function into the separate averages over individual stimulus measurements we can now deal with missing values by simply removing them from the average.\n",
