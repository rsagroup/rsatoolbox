Python Representational Similarity Analysis (PyRSA) toolbox
***********************************************************

The PyRSA toolbox is developed through a community effort by the labs of Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen, and Ian Charest. It was conceived during the RSA retreat 2019 in Blue Mountains, Ontario. The toolbox replaces the 2013 matlab version the toolbox of pyrsa previously at ilogue/pyrsa and reflects many of the new methodological developements.
