Getting started
===============

The easiest way to install pyrsa is with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install rsa3

To use pyrsa:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy, pyrsa
    data = pyrsa.data.Dataset(numpy.random.rand(10, 5))
    rdms = pyrsa.rdm.calc_rdm(data)
    pyrsa.vis.show_rdm(rdms)

Also make sure your setup meets the requirements to run the toolbox with the relevant toolboxes installed (see requirements.txt). 

As in introduction, we recommend having a look at the Jupyter notebooks in ``demos``.
